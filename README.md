- 👋 Hi, I’m @br0nco640k
- 👀 I’m interested in game development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Godot and GDscript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games and game related software
- 📫 How to reach me ... No contact info!

I'm in the process of starting up my own game development studio, which I'll share later on. I currently develop in Unreal Engine 5.3. I abandoned Unity completely after the runtime fee nonsense.

I have worked with a wide variety of programming languages over the decades, including BASIC, pascal, C, C++, C#, REXX, BASH, MS-DOS batch files,
and even LabVIEW. I have worked with Apple II's, Macs, the Commodore VIC-20 and Amiga, various large UNIX systems, IBM 370 mainframes, almost every
version of Windows (except 1.0), FreeBSD, various Linux distros going back to Slackware in the 90's, and assorted other systems.

I'm integrating Git and GitHub more deeply into my workflow recently. I'm using Godot 4.x, Unreal Engine 5, Visual Studio, and GitHub Desktop in my daily work.

I'm not currently using AI for anything. At all.
