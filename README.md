- 👋 Hi, I’m @br0nco640k
- 👀 I’m interested in game development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c#, Python and GDscript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games and game related software
- 📫 How to reach me ... No contact info!

I'm in the process of starting up my own game development studio. I currently develop games and some non-game software in Godot. In my spare
time I work on Bard Diva, which is a bard performance app for Final Fantasy XIV that is written in Python for Linux, Mac and Windows.

I have worked with a wide variety of programming languages over the decades, including BASIC, pascal, C, C++, C#, REXX, BASH, MS-DOS batch files,
and even LabVIEW. I have worked with Apple II's, Macs, the Commodore VIC-20 and Amiga, various large UNIX systems, IBM 370 mainframes, almost every
version of Windows (except 1.0), FreeBSD, various Linux distros going back to Slackware in the 90's, and assorted other systems.

I'm dual booting Windows 11 and Bazzite Linux for my daily work right now. My main project is a vtuber app that will be cross platform (Windows, Mac, 
and Linux).

I'm not currently using AI for anything, but I'll be re-evaluating it soon, when it can do something more useful than drawing people with extra
limbs or writing really terrible code that I'll have to fix myself anyway.
