- 👋 Hi, I’m @br0nco640k
- 👀 I’m interested in game development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games and game related software
- 📫 How to reach me ... No contact info!

I'm in the process of starting up my own game development studio, which I'll share later on. I'm going through the excrutiating process of learning how to use Unity.

I have worked with a wide variety of programming languages over the decades, including BASIC, pascal, C, C++, C#, REXX, BASH, MS-DOS batch files,
and even LabVIEW. I have worked with Apple II's, Macs, the Commodore VIC-20 and Amiga, various large UNIX systems, IBM 370 mainframes, almost every
version of Windows (except 1.0), FreeBSD, various Linux distros going back to Slackware in the 90's, and assorted other systems. Currently I work and game almost exclusively on Linux.

I just moved back to using Arch Linux (btw, lol) and KDE as my daily driver again, after doing a month long "Windows challenge". Windows was fine for a few days, but later on it began driving me absolutely crazy. The only thing I hate more than Windows... is Gnome!
