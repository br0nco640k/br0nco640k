- 👋 Hi, I’m @br0nco640k
- 👀 I’m interested in game development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GDScript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games and game related software
- 📫 How to reach me ... No contact info!

I'm in the process of starting up my own game development studio, which I'll share later on. I just moved my game development work back to Godot after trying out Unity for a while (and hating it). Now I'm getting ready to move to Godot 4.0!

I have worked with a wide variety of programming languages over the decades, including BASIC, pascal, C, C++, C#, REXX, BASH, MS-DOS batch files,
and even LabVIEW. I have worked with Apple II's, Macs, the Commodore VIC-20 and Amiga, various large UNIX systems, IBM 370 mainframes, almost every
version of Windows (except 1.0), FreeBSD, various Linux distros going back to Slackware in the 90's, and assorted other systems. Currently I work and game almost exclusively on Linux.

My daily driver is Fedora 37 at the moment.
